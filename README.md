# React TypeScript Starter Repo

Hello! This repository has been pre-configured with eslint and gh-pages to automatically deploy your app when you push to the main branch.

## NOTE FOR GRADER

I debugged this on another repository but was unable to get it to deploy. This is my second attempt using the original forked repo. Just for clarity, I did the following after solving this problem on the original repo but failing to have it deploy:
- I added that repo as a remote (`git remote add original_fix https://github.com/sbrugel/fixed-quizzer.git`)
- I fetched the commits from that remote (`git fetch original_fix`)
